# To-Do Fixes
- _session_form.css: User signup form: when attempting to sign up with a password that's too short, CSS changes upon error rendering. This becomes a bigger issue if you also sign up with an existing user's username (additional errors)



####################################################################################
1) testing window.store = configureStore(); and receiving
    error message: "Uncaught TypeError: window.configureStore is not a function
        at <anonymous>:1:8"

    seems to be related to:
      Warning: Failed prop type: The prop `store` is marked as required in `Provider`, but its value is `undefined`.
        in Provider (created by Root)
        in Root

    solution: configureStore wasn't returning anything meaningful. Initial code had {} in function definition. Replaced with ()'s

2) testing window.store.dispatch(login(user)) and receiving
    error message: "window.store.getStatus()
      VM3953:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getStatus' of undefined
      at <anonymous>:1:13

    solution: Navigation to root page and adding store (entry file) and login method(inside action file) to window

3) loading localhost:3000 during routes update for SessionFormContainer
    error message: "Uncaught Error: Module build failed: SyntaxError: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <Router> (15:8)"

    solution: Remove self-closing JSX tag from Route (closed later after nested routes. Nested routes created need for closing </Route> tag, so original self-closing tag could be made into an opening tag)

4) receiving 401 errors (invalid credentials on signup and login). State looks
    correct in React console, but server side returns errors.
    error message: Started POST "/api/session" for ::1 at 2017-03-15 08:39:15 -0700
    Processing by Api::SessionsController#create as JSON
    Parameters: {"user"=>{"user"=>{"username"=>"andrew", "password"=>"[FILTERED]"}}}
    Unpermitted parameter: user
    User Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."username" IS NULL LIMIT $1  [["LIMIT", 1]]
    Completed 401 Unauthorized in 1ms (Views: 0.1ms | ActiveRecord: 0.4ms)

    solution: user was nested. Removing { } around user in api (session) call resolved issue

5) after updating to clear errors on form change, currentUser not persisting.
    Server is returning 200
    message

    During clear errors, had added dispatch(clearErrors) to signup and login actions. This was removed because SessionReducer clears errors on merge with _nullUser
