1) testing window.store = configureStore(); and receiving
    error message: "Uncaught TypeError: window.configureStore is not a function
        at <anonymous>:1:8"

    seems to be related to:
      Warning: Failed prop type: The prop `store` is marked as required in `Provider`, but its value is `undefined`.
        in Provider (created by Root)
        in Root

    solution: configureStore wasn't returning anything meaningful. Initial code had {} in function definition. Replaced with ()'s

2) testing window.store.dispatch(login(user)) and receiving
    error message: "window.store.getStatus()
      VM3953:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getStatus' of undefined
      at <anonymous>:1:13

    solution: Navigation to root page and adding store (entry file) and login method(inside action file) to window

3) loading localhost:3000 during routes update for SessionFormContainer
    error message: "Uncaught Error: Module build failed: SyntaxError: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <Router> (15:8)"

    solution: Remove self-closing JSX tag from Route (closed later after nested routes. Nested routes created need for closing </Route> tag, so original self-closing tag could be made into an opening tag)
