* testing window.store = configureStore(); and receiving
    error message: "Uncaught TypeError: window.configureStore is not a function
        at <anonymous>:1:8"

    seems to be related to:
      Warning: Failed prop type: The prop `store` is marked as required in `Provider`, but its value is `undefined`.
        in Provider (created by Root)
        in Root

    solution: configureStore wasn't returning anything meaningful. Initial code had {} in function definition. Replaced with ()'s
